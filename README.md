Completed for The Odin's Project Landing Page project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

This project is a simple, generic landing page that could be used in numerous ways.

The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate an ability to use CSS, specifically Flexbox, to position various elements on an HTML page.

Flexbox has numerous properties within that were used, including justify-content, align-content, flex-grow and others.
